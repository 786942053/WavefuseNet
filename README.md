We are very pleased to announce that our paper has been accepted by *GIScience & Remote Sensing*. We will organize and release the complete code as soon as possible. Our model training and testing processes were conducted based on the code frameworks of **UANet** and **BuildFormer**, and we would like to express our sincere thanks to both teams for sharing their code.

We currently only upload a model weight file that has been trained on the WHU data set for reference.

The training model on the WHU dataset is available through the link [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KLve34Wt8BsJTKwwHnUUGQ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Tom1tMFwqdTGDrj8E3W_HQ?pwd=5k1f)
